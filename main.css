<h1>About Me:</h1>

<h3><p>My name is Addison Howley, I'm a 21 year old Communications & PR Student at Eastern Washington University. I enjoy hiking, cooking and spending time with my friends and family. I aspire to travel the world in my twenties and work my way to a career in Public Relations. </p>
<p>My favorite book is "The Giver," which is about a utoipia society where no one feels emotions or has personal relationships. But one man is assigned as "The Giver" who is 'assigned' to feel all the emotion for society as a whole. He ends up falling in love with a woman (illegally) and they try to escape the society's rules. </p>
